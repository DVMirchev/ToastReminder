# ToastReminder

A simple program that displays the time and date every 15 mins with a Windows Toast.

Its good to keep track of time

It is a Windows 10 app compiled with MSVC 2015 Update 3. 

There are a several images - 00.jpg, 15.jpg, 30.jpg, 45.jpg and glavata.jpg (this is my head) that needs to be copied to the folder where the .exe is but it will work without them. (I intended to add different audio too but hit something and it works fine as it is)

Compile, run and enjoy. I personally find it very helpful!
